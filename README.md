## Tasks
* Convert text into an image in a frame
* Do a sequence of all texts and images in chronological order
* Display each video frame for 3 seconds

## How to execute
Need to install tweepy and acquire Twitter API key
`pip install tweepy`

Need to install ffmpeg
`pip install ffmpeg`

You will also need to provide your own API tokens and secrets by creating a file named 'keys'. The content of keys should look like:
```
[auth]
[auth]
consumer_key = ****
consumer_secret = ****
access_token = ****

## Questions to be Answered
- How many API calls you can handle simultaneously and why?
    + 4 API calls are handled simultaneously. It is a reasonable number that is easy to read and test. For my and most computers, it is an acceptable thread number to process.
- Split API calls at the same time?
    + Yes. Inputs for API calls are collected at once and queued and the queue can be called at the same time.
- Split the processing of an API into multiple threads?
    + For an individual API call, there is no part of it is splitted.
